## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * A running **Spigot 1.8.8** server.
    * Access to a MongoDB instance (local or remote).
2.  **Download:**
    * Download the latest `FriendSystem.jar` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Ch2mpion/FriendSystem/releases/tag/Plugin).
3.  **Place in Plugins Folder:**
    * Drag and drop the downloaded `FriendSystem.jar` file into your server's `plugins/` directory.
4.  **Configure MongoDB:**
    * Start your server once to generate the `config.yml` file in `plugins/FriendSystem/`.
    * Open `plugins/FriendSystem/config.yml` and configure your MongoDB connection details:
        ```yaml
        mongodb:
          uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017" # Your MongoDB connection URI
          database: "friendsDB"           # The name of the database to use
        ```
        **Important:** Ensure there is a space after the colon for `uri:` and `database:`.
5.  **Restart/Reload:**
    * Restart your server, or use a plugin manager to load `FriendSystem`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `config.yml` file allows you to define your MongoDB connection:

```yaml
# config.yml located in plugins/FriendSystem/

mongodb:
  uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017" # REQUIRED: Your MongoDB connection URI.
                                   # Example for a local MongoDB: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
                                   # Example for a remote MongoDB Atlas: "mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/retryWrites=true&w=majority"
  database: "friendsDB"           # REQUIRED: The name of the database where FriendSystem data will be stored.
                                   # Ensure there is a space after the colon for both 'uri:' and 'database:'.

```
